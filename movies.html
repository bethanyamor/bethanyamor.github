			<p> 'Chasing The Past' is about becoming paranoid and feeling followed. While getting weird looks from their peers Salem runs through the halls of their school. Until they hear familiar voices... 'Chasing The Past' is all about how growing up can be scary and all we wish to do is hold onto the past as the future keeps chasing and catching up to us.  </p>

			<p> 'Detention' is a story about a group of kids running away from having to sit in detention, but they run into one of the teachers. They must continue running and using costumes to get away from the teachers as each person slowly gets caught. Finally, they make it out but loose a few peers along the way. The fun and emotional journy the actors put the audience through makes this movie worth watching with teh comidic breaks and screams that are full of emotion when loosing each friend.   </p>
